          <p>Hey there! I'm running as president because I want to create a school environment where students opinions are heard because I believe anyone of any age have their own mind and should not be underestimated because of their age. I also want to make TRIS a place where we all can be ourselves and spend our last years as children having fun! I want everyone to be able to look back and laugh. I will do my best to fulfill this opportunity and create a school where everyone is looking forward to go to everyday. </p>
